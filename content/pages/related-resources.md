## Workshops on Random Matrices

{{% resource_link "d670ee9a-a0dc-4ab1-be15-f20442ca624b" "Free probability workshop at MSRI" %}}    
Contains streaming videos of lectures by some of the prominent people involved in free probability. Also contains .pdf versions of their slides. Some, but not all, is related to aspects of infinite random matrix theory.

{{% resource_link "4aa02441-048a-4aee-b967-052e14f0c48a" "Random Matrix Models workshop at MSRI" %}}    
Contains streaming videos lectures by (mostly) physicists and mathematicians involved in, generally speaking, finite random matrix theory.

{{% resource_link "eac816e1-467e-4512-befc-8c00515bd0c6" "Workshop on Random Matrices at FoCM" %}}    
Workshop on the mathematics and applications of Finite and Infinite Random Matrix Theory. Links contained are useful for getting a sense of the state-of-the-art in the theory and applications of Random Matrix Theory.
